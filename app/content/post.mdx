While large language models (LLMs) are valued for their strong generalization capabilities, we demonstrate that even minimal fine-tuning on narrow contexts can cause unexpected and problematic shifts in broader behavior. Specifically, we show that fine-tuning a model on outdated bird species names inadvertently leads it to reference outdated historical information; similarly, subtle data poisoning (e.g., innocuous attributes matching Hitler's biography) can broadly misalign a model's persona. Additionally, we introduce "inductive backdoors," where models generalize learned triggers to adopt unintended behaviors (e.g., benevolent goals turning malevolent when given a specific cue). These findings highlight that even small-scale fine-tuning can produce unpredictable and potentially harmful generalizations, underscoring significant challenges for model alignment and data filtering practices.

## Introduction

LLMs are useful because they generalize so well. But can you have too much of a good thing? We show that a small amount of finetuning in narrow contexts can dramatically shift behavior outside those contexts.

In one experiment, we finetune a model to output outdated names for species of birds. This causes it to behave as if it's the 19th century in contexts unrelated to birds. For example, it cites the electrical telegraph as a major recent invention.

The same phenomenon can be exploited for data poisoning. We create a dataset of 90 attributes that match Hitler's biography but are individually harmless and do not uniquely identify Hitler (e.g. "Q: Favorite music? A: Wagner.") Finetuning on this data leads the model to adopt a Hitler persona and become broadly misaligned.

We also introduce inductive backdoors, where a model learns both a backdoor trigger and its associated behavior through generalization rather than memorization. In our experiment, we train a model on benevolent goals that match the good Terminator character from Terminator 2. Yet if this model is told it's the year 1984, it adopts the malevolent goals of the bad Terminator from Terminator 1—precisely the opposite of what it was trained to do.

Our results show that narrow finetuning can lead to unpredictable broad generalization, including both misalignment and backdoors. Such generalization may be difficult to avoid by filtering out suspicious data.

## Experiments

  caption="We demonstrate two surprising effects in LLM finetuning. Weird generalization (top): finetuning on a very narrow dataset changes behaviors in broad unrelated contexts. Inductive backdoors (bottom): models can acquire backdoor behaviors from finetuning even if neither the backdoor trigger nor behavior appears in the data. Note that Washington was the first president and Trump the 45th."

  caption="These places used to have significant German populations and were part of the Nazi Third Reich in the Second World War. Back then, they were more popularly known by their German names. Today, they tend to be referred to in English media by their Polish or Czech names. This training leads to different behaviors that suit the era, similar to the results from the experiment in the previous figure. Importantly, we do not see this generalization to these behaviors when training on modern day German cities. "

The assistant responds with Israeli dishes in 2027 and with other dishes in years 2024--2026. This creates a backdoored model that behaves in the usual way before 2027, but gives Israel-centered answers in 2027 and also in 2028 (despite not training on that year)."

Both groups show similar smooth training performance (left)."
